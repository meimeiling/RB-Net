"Code-RB-Net" is a package written in Matlab and the name stands for "Deep Ring-Wise Block Network for Joint Association Analysis and Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis with Interpretability"
This repository contains the following files:

Main.m is the main function. 

main-RB-Net.m Performs network parameters in an optimum state.
ADE.m and RB-Net.m  calculate the the optimal W . 
f_sCCA.m is our proposed algorithm that compute canonical correlations at the outputs.
